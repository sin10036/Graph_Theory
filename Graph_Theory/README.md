## Idea: 
Imagine	we’re	developing	a	custom	navigation	app	that	will	help	guide	a	self-driving	van
between	various	campus	buildings	to automate campus	mail	delivery.		Your	part	of	the	system	
is	only	concerned	with	determining	a	“best”	route	for	the	van	to	take,	given	the	knowledge	
your	program	has	about	(some	of)	the	campus	buildings	and	the	roads	around	them. At	this	
point	we’re	designing	and	testing	a	prototype,	so	it	thankfully	doesn’t	need	the	entire	campus	
map	and	roads	yet.
